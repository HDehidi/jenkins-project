# What is Jenkins

Jenkins: is a automation platform allows us to build, test & deploy software
 using pipeline, but it can be used to automate any task.

## Jenkins Infrastructure

Master Server:

- Controls Pipelines.
- Schedules Build.

Agents/Minions:

- Perform the build.

## Example workflow

A developer commits code to a github repo. The Jenkins master becomes aware of this commit and triggers on of the pipelines, and then distributes the build to one of the agents to run, it select the agents based on labels, the agent runs the build which is linux commands to build test and distribute.

1. Commit Triggers Pipeline.
2. Agent Selected based on Configured Labels.
3. Agent Runs Build.

## Agent Types

Permanent Agents:

- Dedicated Servers for Running Jobs.

Cloud Agents:

- (Popular choice) Dynamic Agents spun up on demand, Ex. Docker, K8S & AWS fleet manager.

## Build Types

Freestyle Build:

- Simples method to create a build.

Pipelines:

- Use the Groovy Syntax, pipeline stages: Clone, Build, Test, Package, Deploy.
